DSP-and-DC-Lab
==============

A python based alternative for MATLAB, SciPy is used here. Entire code sets are reimplemented using python. A good start for python beginners. Please contribute if you know python. Also check for errors.
## Why is such an initiative important
I think that Open Source is one of the most valued knowledge in the field of Computer Science and as we all know we have to know how it ticks and works. The entire idea of this repository is to make the interested ones familiar with how it works and also give a brief knowledge about MATLAB and its alternatives. I think this would greatly improve your skills in this domain. Best of Luck.
## Things to note while contributing
* Note that this is an initiative to learn DCVS SCM and a good start for python newbies.
* We value the correctness of the code.
* Please 'fork' the repository and make changes rather than working in the upstream.
* Open a pull request and start if you think your code is optimized which we will approve on checking.
* Please try to improve your code on a regular basis. Open a pull request only
when you are sure it is optimised.
* Every effort is appreciable. If you have a correct MATLAB code please put it in, so that we can port it to Python.

##A guide to install and use Scipy
* The link for installing SciPy Stack is given [here](http://www.scipy.org/install.html).
* Please note that if you
are using any other distribution that uses package managers other than apt the dependencies may vary. Please contact me in case of a specific package.
* SciPy is quite abundant in its set of tools and it is only the effort of going
through the documentation.
* Please try to upload only codes. The images that are generated should not be kept with the library. Please remove then during 'commit'.
* Please be responsible for your work. 

## A piece of advice
This is just an effort and any suggestions for improvement is welcome. Later I will improve the scenario with 'branch' and 'blame'. Please note that whatever your knowledge base is you can join and contribute a little. Guidelines will be updated in accordance to the users.
