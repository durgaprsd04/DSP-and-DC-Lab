Digital Signal Processing using SciPy.
==============

A repository for a collection of  Digital Signal Processing experiments written in SciPy. Beginning with the experiments conducted in DC and DSP labs in NITC.

## Why SciPy?

[Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/index.html) is an opensource python library developed for scientific computing. It has a [great community](http://planet.scipy.org/), and is actively developed. It has a lot of core packages including [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [Ipython](http://ipython.org/), and [Sympy](http://sympy.org/en/index.html). 

All these are open source and have great libraries in par with MATLAB. This repository is an effort to eliminate costly proprietary software and contribute to the development of open source computing in the engineering and scientific research. 

## Why contribute?
Open Source development is one of the most intersting areas of the Computer Science. You get to learn a lot of good and stuff and find super awesome people. Probably the best way to learn anything!

The motivation behind setting up this repository is to make interested people familiar with how GITHUB works and also give a brief introduction to other opensource alternatives to MATLAB. These tools are invaluable for any professional and academic reasearch and we believe that the right time to learn them is while still in college. You can contribute to this repo with whatever you could and hence be part of a fraternity trying to replace the costly propritary software with something we could get for free.

#### If you cannot contribute in python, you could upload your working MATLAB code to the stock folder so that some one could work on it. 


## Things to note while contributing
* Note that this is an initiative to learn DCVS SCM and a good start for python newbies.
* We value the correctness of the code.
* Please 'fork' the repository and make changes rather than working in the upstream.
* Open a pull request and start if you think your code is optimized which we will approve on checking.
* Please try to improve your code on a regular basis. Open a pull request only
when you are sure it is optimised.
* Every effort is appreciable. If you have a correct MATLAB code please put it in, so that we can port it to Python. Make sure that you upload the code to stock MATLAB folder. 
* If you don't know python, but is still interested in contributing, you may upload your MATLAB codes to the stock MATLAB folder. 

##A guide to install and use Scipy
* The link for installing SciPy Stack is given [here](http://www.scipy.org/install.html).
* Please note that if you
are using any other distribution that uses package managers other than apt the dependencies may vary. Please contact me in case of a specific package.
* SciPy is quite abundant in its set of tools and it is only the effort of going
through the documentation.
* Please try to upload only codes. The images that are generated should not be kept with the library. Please remove them during 'commit'.
* Please be responsible for your work. 

## Getting started with git. 
 
You can access a great article [here](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1), on how to get started with git. The [community](https://help.github.com/) is awesome and you wouldn't be feeling deserted when you run into any trouble.

## End Note.
This is just an effort to do something good and all suggestions for improvement are heartily welcomed. 

As things move further, we will be improving the repository management with features like 'branch' and 'blame'. To keep things simple, we will adhere to the simple git repo management in the beginning. Please note that whatever your knowledge base maybe, you could join us there is still a lot you could do. Guidelines will be updated in accordance to the users.
