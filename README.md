DSP-and-DC-Lab
==============

A python based alternative for MATLAB, SciPy is used here. Entire code sets are reimplemented using python. A good start for python beginners. Please contribute if you know python. Also check for errors.
# Things to note while contributing
Note that this is an initiative to learn DCVS SCM and a good start for python newbies.
We value the correctness of the code.
Please 'fork' the repository and make changes rather than working in the upstream.
Open a pull request and start which we will approve.
Please try to improve your code on a regular basis. Open a pull request only
when you are sure it is optimised.
# A guide to install and use Scipy
Note that this is a direct copy from the SciPy website. Please note that if you
are using any other distribution that uses package managers other than apt. The
dependencies may vary. Please contact me in case of a specific package.
SciPy is quite abundant in its set of tools and it is only th effort of going
through the documentation.
